# Pluralsight Intro to PHP Fundamentals Course

Jill Gunderson is teaching a class introducing PHP itself for Pluralsight.  
I am interested in PHP, but I've never had a course on the language itself
apart from something like Wordpress.  This course also covers connecting
with MySQL databases, so I'll be interested in how this turns out.

For now, we're just getting some of the basic conventions down.
